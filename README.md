## How It Works
1. The software starts by analyzing price movements by retrieving historical data. The maximum number of data points to be stored is defined by the constant `MAX_DATA_POINTS`.
2. The `AnalyzePriceMovements()` function simulates the retrieval of historical data by storing dummy price data in the `priceData` array. The `dataCount` variable keeps track of the number of data points.
3. The `IdentifyTrends()` function determines the trend direction based on the latest price movements. It compares the current price (`currentPrice`) with the previous price (`previousPrice`) and assigns a trend direction (`trendDirection`) accordingly.
4. The software generates a trend line on the chart using the actual code to generate the trend line. The visualization code for displaying the trend line and trend direction goes here.
5. The `RealTimeUpdates()` function continuously monitors market data, updates the trend line and trend direction based on new price movements, and visualizes the changes.
6. The `GraphicalVisualization()` function creates a graphical interface with real-time graphs and charts. It presents the trend line and trend direction clearly and intuitively. Traders can customize the display settings according to their preferences.
7. The `UserFriendlyInterface()` function designs a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and labels for each functionality. It also implements error handling and validation for user inputs.
8. The `CompatibilityTesting()` function tests the software's compatibility with different operating systems, devices, and screen resolutions. It also supports multiple languages for international users.
9. The `PerformanceOptimization()` function optimizes the software's performance by minimizing resource usage and enhancing stability and scalability. It tests the software for stability and scalability.
10. The `OnStart()` function is the main function of the software. It executes the following steps in sequence:
    1. Analyze price movements.
    2. Identify trends.
    3. Perform real-time updates.
    4. Create a graphical visualization.
    5. Design a user-friendly interface.
